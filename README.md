!!! If updating to a new release, for the time being, please backup any custom scripts/objects stored in the OptiFax toolbox folders, uninstall the toolbox then install the new release. You can then add the custom files back by combining the scripts/objects folders. !!!

A prerequisite guide will follow soon.
